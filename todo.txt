* clicking on node it sublist seems to put the graph hiliting in a wierd state


DONE
* cache and log dirs need to be chmod 777 before log file or specific cache dirs can be created
	We now gracefully give errors when we can't write or find cache and log dirs
* graphviz code fails if there is an unescaped \r anywhere in a field or blurb.  Maybe we could add a check to give a warning? otherwise hard to debug
	We just remove all newlines before sending DOT file to GV
* problem when GraphList.js writes out onclick links during listSubNodeEntry: onclick='graphframework.selectNode(\""+node.id+"\");'  it needs to refer to the name of the actuall instance of Graphframework, how can it discover that within the code?
* doesn't apply zoom after initial load
* scroll wheel zoom gets out of sync on chromium, makes it possible to zoom out too far
