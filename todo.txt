* cache and log dirs need to be chmod 777 before log file or specific cache dirs can be created
* problem when GraphList.js writes out onclick links during listSubNodeEntry: onclick='graphframework.selectNode(\""+node.id+"\");'  it needs to refer to the name of the actuall instance of Graphframework, how can it discover that within the code?
* graphviz code fails if there is an unescaped \r anywhere in a field or blurb.  Maybe we could add a check to give a warning? otherwise hard to debug
* clicking on node it sublist seems to put the graph hiliting in a wierd state
* scroll wheel zoom gets out of sync on chromium, makes it possible to zoom out too far
* doesn't apply zoom after initial load
