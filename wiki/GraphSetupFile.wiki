#explanation of how the networks are defined

= Loading data into a graph =

NodeViz uses a custom Graph object to store and manipulate the network data which will be passed to the client. Usually the best way to create a new type of network is to create a new class which extends the Graph.php class and sets all the network properties appropriately.  When NodeViz attempts to build the specific type of graph, it will expect to find a certain set of functions which will return necessary data about the graph.  

Note: we've structured the order of the graph construction in this way to facilitate our most common use case: pulling the data for the graph out of a set of tables in a database.

The basic idea is:
  # Define a graph object with some meta properties, includeing the types of nodes and edges
  # Repeat for each node type: 
    * Call a function to get a list of the ids so that we know what they are and how many, add to graph array
    * Call a function that, given the list of ids, fills in sets of properties for each id on the graph array. Also do any processing to scale or format values, etc.
  # Repeat for each edge type:
    * Call a function to get a list of edge ids and add them to the graph array.
    * Call a function that, given a list of edge ids, fills in sets of properties for each edge.
  # Do some state checking, index construction, etc. 
  # Pass the graph on to the rest of the framework to do what is needed with it. 




== Functions in the GraphSetupFile ==

Generally the best way to create a new GraphSetupFile is to copy a [http://code.google.com/p/nodeviz/source/browse/www/framework/application/DemoGraph.php demo file] and modify it.  Below is an outline of the main functions and what they do. All of the properties are defined as a nested set of associative arrays. 

{{{ 
__construct()
}}}
This method is called at the beginning of graph construction and should define any graph-level properties and "meta" information about the network being constructed -- such as the parameters that define the graph.  Essential elements include"
  * *nodetypes*  defines the names of the various "classes" of nodes that will be included in the network. (i.e. a [http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph bi-partite] network will have more than one node type)
  * *edgetypes*  names the 'classes' of edges, and which types of nodes they will connect
  * *properties* defines the graph-level properties. The arrays of values stored  'minSize' and 'maxSize' will control the relative sizes of nodes in the rendered network.
  * *graphvizProperties* An array of GraphViz graph-level properties that will impact how GraphViz renders the network.  The properties and their acceptable values are defined in the GraphViz attribute [http://http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs documentation].

The *nodetypes* and *edgetypes* arrays actually define the names of the sets of methods that will be used to construct the nodes and edges. NodeViz expects to find a {{{<nodetype>_fetchNodes()}}} and {{{<nodetype>_fetchNodeProperties}}} function for each node type and a {{{<edgetype>_fedgeEdges()}}} and {{{<edgetype>_fetchEdgeProperties()}}} function for each edge type.  For example, if your graph defines:
{{{
$this->data['nodetypes'] = array('animals', 'foods');
}}}
then it expects to find functions named:
{{{
function animals_fetchNodes(){
}

function animals_fetchNodeProperties(){
}

function foods_fetchNodes(){
}

function foods_fetchNodeProperties(){
}
}}}
